- Node.js with [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) support

## Installation

### From GitHub (recommended)

You can install the plugin directly from GitHub using one of the following methods:

#### Using Git

```bash
# Clone the repository into your oh-my-zsh custom plugins directory
git clone https://github.com/spencerbeggs/zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch

# Run the interactive installation script
${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch/src/install.sh
```

#### Using curl

```bash
# Download and run the installer script
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spencerbeggs/zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch/main/src/install-remote.sh | zsh
```

#### Using wget

```bash
# Download and run the installer script
wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spencerbeggs/zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch/main/src/install-remote.sh | zsh
```

### Unattended Installation

For automated/unattended installation (using default settings):

#### Git-based unattended installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spencerbeggs/zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch
${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch/src/install.sh --unattended
```

#### curl unattended installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spencerbeggs/zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch/main/src/install-remote.sh | zsh -s -- --unattended
```

#### wget unattended installation

```bash
wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spencerbeggs/zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch/main/src/install-remote.sh | zsh -s -- --unattended
```

### Updating the Plugin

To update the plugin to the latest version, you can use the built-in update command:

```bash
# Update the plugin to the latest version
nvm_pnpm_auto_switch_update
```

This command will automatically detect the best method to update the plugin (Git, curl, or wget), and will handle the update process for you.

Alternatively, you can manually update using one of the installation methods:

```bash
# If you used Git
cd ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch
git pull
./src/install.sh

# Or use the remote installer again
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spencerbeggs/zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch/main/src/install-remote.sh | zsh
```

During an update, you'll be asked if you want to reconfigure your settings or keep your existing configuration.

### Uninstalling the Plugin

To remove the plugin and all related files and settings, use the built-in uninstall command:

```bash
# Uninstall the plugin
nvm_pnpm_auto_switch_uninstall
```

This command will:
- Remove all environment variables from your `.zshenv` file
- Remove the plugin from your `.zshrc` file
- Delete the plugin directory
- Unset all environment variables for the current session
- Provide instructions for completing the uninstallation

### Manual installation

1. Copy the plugin files to your ZSH plugins directory:
   ```bash
   # Create the plugin directory if it doesn't exist
   mkdir -p ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch
   
   # Copy the main plugin file
   cp src/zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch.plugin.zsh ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch/
   
   # Copy the workspace configuration file
   cp src/workspace-config.zsh ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch/
   ```

2. Add the plugin to your `.zshrc`:
   ```bash
   plugins=(... zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch)
   ```

3. Add the required environment variables to your `.zshenv`:
   ```bash
   # Workspace directory for zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch plugin
   export NVM_PNPM_AUTO_SWITCH_WORKSPACE="$HOME/workspace"

   # Enable project listing in workspace (0=off, 1=on)
   export NVM_PNPM_AUTO_SWITCH_LIST_PROJECTS=0

   # Enable debug mode for zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch (0=off, 1=on)
   export NVM_PNPM_AUTO_SWITCH_DEBUG=0
   ```

4. Restart your shell or run:
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

## Usage

Once installed, the plugin works automatically:

1. When you `cd` into a directory containing a `package.json` file, the plugin activates.
2. If a `.npmrc` file exists with a `node-version` specification, the plugin switches to that version.
3. If the project uses `pnpm` (specified in the `packageManager` field of `package.json`), the plugin ensures Corepack is enabled and the correct pnpm version is activated.

The plugin only displays messages when it needs to switch Node.js versions or update package managers.

## Available Commands

After installation, the following commands are available to help you manage the plugin:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `nvm_pnpm_auto_switch_help` | Display detailed help information about all available commands |
| `nvm_pnpm_auto_switch_man` | Alias for `nvm_pnpm_auto_switch_help` |
| `nvm_pnpm_auto_switch_configure` | Run the interactive configuration wizard |
| `nvm_pnpm_auto_switch_workspace [path]` | View or change the workspace directory |
| `nvm_pnpm_auto_switch_list_projects` | Toggle automatic project listing on/off |
| `nvm_pnpm_auto_switch_debug` | Toggle debug mode on/off |
| `nvm_pnpm_auto_switch_update` | Update the plugin to the latest version from GitHub |
| `nvm_pnpm_auto_switch_uninstall` | Uninstall the plugin and clean up all related files and settings |

### Help and Documentation

```bash
# Display full help information
nvm_pnpm_auto_switch_help

# Alias for help (same as above)
nvm_pnpm_auto_switch_man
```

The help command provides detailed information about all available commands and environment variables. It's a great starting point if you're new to the plugin or need a refresher on what commands are available.

### Interactive Configuration

```bash
# Run the interactive configuration wizard
nvm_pnpm_auto_switch_configure
```

This command launches an interactive configuration wizard that helps you set up or change the plugin's settings. It shows current settings and allows you to update them with guided prompts. Changes are saved to your `.zshenv` file automatically.

### Workspace Directory Management

```bash
# Check the current workspace directory
nvm_pnpm_auto_switch_workspace

# Set a new workspace directory
nvm_pnpm_auto_switch_workspace ~/dev
```

The workspace directory is a special directory where you can enable additional features like project listing. By default, this is set to `~/workspace`, but you can change it to any directory you prefer.

### Project Listing Control

```bash
# Toggle project listing on/off
nvm_pnpm_auto_switch_list_projects
```

When project listing is enabled, the plugin will display a list of available projects when you enter your workspace directory. This is useful for quickly seeing what projects are available.

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Toggle debug mode on/off
nvm_pnpm_auto_switch_debug
```

Debug mode provides detailed information about what the plugin is doing, which can be helpful for troubleshooting. When enabled, you'll see messages about detected Node.js versions, package managers, and more.

### Updating the Plugin

```bash
# Update the plugin to the latest version
nvm_pnpm_auto_switch_update
```

This command will automatically update the plugin to the latest version from GitHub. It will try to use Git if you installed via git clone, or fall back to curl or wget if necessary.

### Uninstalling the Plugin

```bash
# Remove the plugin and clean up all related files and settings
nvm_pnpm_auto_switch_uninstall
```

If you no longer want to use the plugin, this command will completely remove it and clean up all related files and settings. It will ask for confirmation before proceeding.

## Environment Variables

The plugin uses the following environment variables to control its behavior:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `NVM_PNPM_AUTO_SWITCH_WORKSPACE` | Path to your workspace directory | `$HOME/workspace` |
| `NVM_PNPM_AUTO_SWITCH_LIST_PROJECTS` | Enable project listing in workspace (0=off, 1=on) | `0` |
| `NVM_PNPM_AUTO_SWITCH_DEBUG` | Enable debug mode (0=off, 1=on) | `0` |

You can set these variables in your `.zshenv` file manually, or use the `nvm_pnpm_auto_switch_configure` command to set them interactively.

## Example Files

### .npmrc with Node.js version

```
node-version=18.16.0
```

### package.json with package manager specification

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "packageManager": "pnpm@8.15.1"
}
```

## How It Works

The plugin hooks into ZSH's `chpwd` function which is triggered whenever you change directories. It then:

1. Checks if the current directory is your configured workspace
2. Checks if the current directory is a Node.js project
3. Reads the Node.js version from `.npmrc`
4. Switches Node versions using nvm if needed
5. Checks if the project uses pnpm as its package manager
6. Enables Corepack and activates the correct pnpm version if needed
