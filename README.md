# zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch

A ZSH plugin that automatically switches Node.js versions (using `nvm`) and manages `pnpm` package manager versions (using `corepack`) when changing directories.

## Features

- üîÑ Automatically detects and switches to the correct Node.js version specified in `.npmrc` files
- üì¶ Handles `pnpm` package manager versions via Corepack
- üöÄ Seamlessly activates the correct environment when you `cd` into a project
- üîß Installs missing Node.js versions automatically when needed
- üè† Special workspace directory integration with optional project listing
- üò∂ Silent operation by default - only shows messages when needed

## Requirements

- ZSH shell
- [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) (recommended)
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager)
- Node.js with [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) support

## Installation

### From GitHub (recommended)

You can install the plugin directly from GitHub using one of the following methods:

#### Using Git

```bash
# Clone the repository into your oh-my-zsh custom plugins directory
git clone https://github.com/spencerbeggs/zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch

# Run the interactive installation script
${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch/install.sh
```

#### Using curl

```bash
# Download and run the installer script
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spencerbeggs/zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch/main/install-remote.sh | zsh
```

#### Using wget

```bash
# Download and run the installer script
wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spencerbeggs/zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch/main/install-remote.sh | zsh
```

### Unattended Installation

For automated/unattended installation (using default settings):

```bash
# Git-based installation with default settings
git clone https://github.com/spencerbeggs/zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch
${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch/install.sh --unattended

# Or with curl
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spencerbeggs/zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch/main/install-remote.sh | zsh -s -- --unattended

# Or with wget
wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spencerbeggs/zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch/main/install-remote.sh | zsh -s -- --unattended
```

### Manual installation

1. Copy `zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch.plugin.zsh` to your ZSH plugins directory:
   ```bash
   cp zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch.plugin.zsh ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch/
   ```

2. Copy `workspace-config.zsh` to your ZSH plugins directory:
   ```bash
   cp workspace-config.zsh ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch/
   ```

3. Add the plugin to your `.zshrc`:
   ```bash
   plugins=(... zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch)
   ```

4. Add the required environment variables to your `.zshenv`:
   ```bash
   # Workspace directory for zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch plugin
   export NODE_AUTO_SWITCH_WORKSPACE="$HOME/workspace"

   # Enable project listing in workspace (0=off, 1=on)
   export NODE_AUTO_SWITCH_LIST_PROJECTS=0

   # Enable debug mode for zsh-nvm-pnpm-auto-switch (0=off, 1=on)
   export NODE_AUTO_SWITCH_DEBUG=0
   ```

5. Restart your shell or run:
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

## Usage

Once installed, the plugin works automatically:

1. When you `cd` into a directory containing a `package.json` file, the plugin activates.
2. If a `.npmrc` file exists with a `node-version` specification, the plugin switches to that version.
3. If the project uses `pnpm` (specified in the `packageManager` field of `package.json`), the plugin ensures Corepack is enabled and the correct pnpm version is activated.

The plugin only displays messages when it needs to switch Node.js versions or update package managers.

### Configuring Workspace Directory

By default, the plugin uses `~/workspace` as your main workspace directory. You can customize this by setting the `NODE_AUTO_SWITCH_WORKSPACE` environment variable:

```bash
# Set in your .zshrc or .zshenv
export NODE_AUTO_SWITCH_WORKSPACE="$HOME/projects"
```

Alternatively, you can use the provided command:

```bash
# Set the workspace directory for the current session
node_auto_switch_workspace ~/dev

# Check the current workspace directory
node_auto_switch_workspace
```

### Configuring Project Listing

When entering your workspace directory, the plugin can automatically list available projects. This feature is disabled by default for a clean, silent experience. When disabled, no messages are shown at all when entering your workspace.

To enable project listing:

```bash
# Set in your .zshrc or .zshenv (0 = off, 1 = on)
export NODE_AUTO_SWITCH_LIST_PROJECTS=1
```

You can also toggle this feature using the provided command:

```bash
# Toggle project listing on/off
node_auto_switch_list_projects
```

### Debugging

The plugin includes a debug mode to help troubleshoot issues:

```bash
# Toggle debug mode on/off
node_auto_switch_debug
```

When debug mode is enabled, the plugin will output detailed information about what it's doing when you change directories, including in the workspace directory even if project listing is disabled.

## Example Files

### .npmrc with Node.js version

```
node-version=18.16.0
```

### package.json with package manager specification

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "packageManager": "pnpm@8.15.1"
}
```

## How It Works

The plugin hooks into ZSH's `chpwd` function which is triggered whenever you change directories. It then:

1. Checks if the current directory is your configured workspace
2. Checks if the current directory is a Node.js project
3. Reads the Node.js version from `.npmrc`
4. Switches Node versions using nvm if needed
5. Checks if the project uses pnpm as its package manager
6. Enables Corepack and activates the correct pnpm version if needed
